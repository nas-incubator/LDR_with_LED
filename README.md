LDR and LED Control using Arduino
This project demonstrates how to use an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to control an LED using an Arduino. The LED turns on or off based on the ambient light level detected by the LDR.

*Components Required
  Arduino Board
  LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
  8 Bit Led Module
  Jumper Wires

*Circuit Diagram
  LDR: One end connected to 5V, the other end connected to A0 and GND as marked on the module
  LED: Positive leg (longer) connected to pin 2, negative leg connected to GND (through a 220Î© resistor).

  *Uploading the Code
  1. Connect your Arduino: Use the USB cable to connect your Arduino board to your computer.
  2. Select your board and port: In the Arduino IDE, go to Tools > Board and select your Arduino board. Then, go to Tools > Port and select the correct port for your Arduino.
  3. Upload the code: Click the upload button (right arrow) in the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the code to your Arduino board.
